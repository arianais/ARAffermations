# AR Affermations

 **AR Affermations is an iOS application allows users to place positive affermations in their environment using augmented reality.** Using ARKit 2's Multiuser AR capabilities, AR Affermations allows users to share these affermations through a connected AR environment.
 
 ## Getting Started
This app utilizes a simple shared AR expierence for two or more iOS applications. To run this app effectively, please follow the following instructions:

1. Run the app on one device. After scouting out the local environment, tap the plus button to select an affermation you'd like to place in the AR environment. Then, follow the onscreen instructions to place the object effectively. Yellow dots will appear on the screen to guide you to place the affermation in the best location.

2. Then, run the app on another device so that others can see the affermations that you have placed.

3. Tap the "Share environment with other users." button on one device. Make sure the other device is in an area that the first device visited before sending the map, or has a similar view of the surrounding environment.

4. The other device displays a message indicating that it has received the map and is attempting to use it. When that process succeeds, both devices show virtual content at the same real-world positions, and affermations placed will be visible to both devices.

(Some of these instructions were taken from "Creating a Multiuser AR Experience.")
